# Forecasting and Time Series Methods

This is a course in the analysis of time series data with emphasis on appropriate choice of models for estimation, testing, and forecasting. Topics or methodologies covered may include Univariate Box-Jenkins for fitting and forecasting time series; ARIMA models, stationarity and nonstationarity; diagnosing time series models; transformations; forecasting: point and interval forecasts; seasonal time series models; modeling volatility with ARCH, GARCH; modeling time series with trends; and other methods. The R Shiny App development will be covered to help students obtain skills of making prototype of their models and ideas.
